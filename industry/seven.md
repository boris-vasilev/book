Even in you're not a Physicist, there is plenty to see and do above and below ground at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Home to the worlds largest experiment on what is arguably the worlds largest machine near Geneva in Switzerland, CERN a very inspiring place to visit. Consequently, CERN features in many guidebooks like [The Geek Atlas](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-geek-atlas/9780596802257/) [1], the [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cern), [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/switzerland/geneva/attractions/cern/a/poi-sig/409720/360817) and [Tripadvisor.com](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188057-d242814-Reviews-CERN-Geneva.html). So what can you actually see and do at CERN?

1. **Get a job in engineering**. Good news for engineers, there's loads of jobs at CERN. What better way to explore a place than to work there? If you're a student see [careers.cern/students](https://careers.cern/students) for details on summer internships and year long technical student programs. There are also plenty of opportunities for more experienced engineers described at [careers.cern/professionals](https://careers.cern/professionals). CERN's mission is to "[unite people from all over the world to push the frontiers of science and technology, for the benefit of all](https://communications.web.cern.ch/strategy/communications-architecture-vision-mission-and-themes)". Part of that means providing opportunities for people from [CERN's 23 member states](https://home.cern/about/who-we-are/our-governance/member-states) to learn new skills at CERN and take them back to their home country. For every research physicist at CERN, there are ten engineers. [2] To run their experiments, physicists rely on massive, novel and a very precise network of machines made with millions of parts, both moving and stationary. You need an army of engineers to keep build, test, run and develop such a complex machine, for example:
    + Mechanical engineers develop heating & cooling systems and mechatronics
    + Materials engineers test novel materials, metals, magnets, microscopes, superconductors, vacuums, X-ray diffraction and apply radiochemistry
    + Software and hardware engineers develop applications, virtualised infrastructure, distributed computing and databases using a wide range of programming and scripting languages to manage data in one of the most highly demanding computing environments in the research world
    + Electrical and electronic engineers work on energy distribution, signal processing, microelectronics and radiofrequency technology
    + Civil engineers and geotechnical engineerings develop structures, roads, drainage, both above (and under) ground to accommodate all of the above
    + There are non-engineering jobs too, in administration [careers.cern/AdminStudent-projects](https://careers.cern/AdminStudent-projects) and physics (obviously)

So CERN is full of all kinds of engineers. But if you're not a physicist or an engineer looking for a job, there is still plenty to see and do, so let's resume our [listicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle): six things to do at CERN if you're not a physicist (or an engineer):

1. **Watch cosmic rays arrive from outer space**: There are two main permanent exhibitions which can be visited without booking. One is housed in the aesthetically pleasing [Globe of Science and Innovation](https://visit.cern/globe) (GoSI), it's called the [Universe of Particles](https://visit.cern/exhibitions/universe-particles). Another is opposite the GoSI and called [Microcosm](http://microcosm.web.cern.ch/en). There’s plenty to see in both exhibits, including film projections, [spark chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_chamber) showing [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) and [cloud chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber) which allow you to visualise [ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation).
1. **Wander the Immeasurable with Gayle Hermick**: Right outside the GoSI, sits an impressive sculpture made of 15 tonnes of twisted steel, stretched out over 37 metres and up 11 metres into the air. Covered in mathematical equations describing physical laws, they tell the story of physics from [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia) and [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) up to present day Higgs Boson in Europe and beyond. It's a beautiful work of art by [Gayle Hermick](https://www.gaylehermick.com/cern).
1. **Crunch numbers using Einsteins famous equation**: You can’t visit CERN without crunching some numbers. Many people will be familiar Einsteins famous equation of [mass–energy equivalence *E=mc²*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence). What this means that energy can be turned into mass (and vice versa) and the “exchange rate” (*c²*) is a very large number - the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) squared. So, you can turn a small about of mass into a HUGE amount of energy. Armed with your [handy mass–energy calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/emc2), you can crunch numbers, for example 1 kg = 90,000,000,000,000,000 Joules.
1. **Thank the technology mothership**: CERN is [where the web was born](https://home.cern/science/computing/where-web-was-born), which we should all be thankful for. Engineers at CERN have also made [significant contributions to touchscreen technology](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1248908?ln=en) via the capacitive screens in use as early as 1973. [3] Cloud computing has some of its roots in [Grid Computing developed at CERN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj8ZNgnzSSU) too. [4] Key pieces of widely-used open source software like [Ceph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph_(software)) and [OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack) have been developed at CERN too. Where would we be without massive international collaborations? Find out about investment creates a positive impact on society through knowledge transfer at [kt.cern](https://kt.cern)
1. **Boggle at the Big Data**: Data speaks louder than words. Here is some random data for your mind to boggle on. Some of the detectors observe up to 40 million events *per second*. The LHC Grid computing generates 30 petabytes per year, with  300 petabytes of data permanently archived in its tape libraries as of October 2018. The big loop is 27km long, travelling close to the speed of light, a proton laps the circuit 11,000 times *every second*. There are 100,000 scientists from over 100 countries working at CERN.  More boggling can be done in the [CERN data centre](https://home.cern/science/computing/data-centre), especially the Key Facts and Figures. [5]. If you want to vist the data centre then you can ...
1. **Contribute to the Grid**: Physicists from all over the world work on the data produced by the experiments. This requires immense computing power no single machine can provide. This is why the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid([WLCG](https://wlcg-public.web.cern.ch/)) exists. With the improvements of the LHC more and more computing power is required to crunch the data. Everyone can contribute to that by taking part in the [LHC@home](https://lhcathome.cern.ch/lhcathome/) project. Who knows? Maybe you can be a part of the discovery of the new mysterious particle or the proof that physicists have been struggling with for decades.
1. **Book a tour**: While the permanent exhibitions at the GoSI require no booking, tours do. They fill up quickly and provide access to other parts of CERN such as the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/discover/about), [synchro-cyclotron](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/synchrocyclotron) and [CERN data centre](https://home.cern/science/computing). Very limited underground visits are possible during the shutdown of the Large Hadron Coller (LHC). [5] The synchro-cyclotron tells the story of CERN from 1957, when the first particle accelerator arrived on the back of a large lorry. Today it spans 27 km of France and Switzerland. How did that happen? Using lights and projectors, the exhibition brings the story to life in an illuminating way.


If you ever get the chance to [visit.cern](http://visit.cern/), it is well worth it and not just for physicists and engineers.
<!--etc. I’m told the control centre is fun, and obviously it would be great to see some of the detector hardware up close but you can only do this when it is turned off. There I’ve been lucky in that all my tour guides have been technical students and their managers, thanks have some tour guides to show me around,

<!--but virtual tour https://www.google.com/maps/@46.251492,6.0209859,0a,112.6y,316.16h,78.31t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s8VugZaYh_4BFWjYlKHvt8g!2e0?source=apiv3-->

Thanks to current and former CERN technical students from the University of Manchester for their tours (virtual and actual) of CERN and comments on drafts of this article: Raluca, Simeon, Boris and Mariya ... (permission pending). If I missed anything, let me know.
